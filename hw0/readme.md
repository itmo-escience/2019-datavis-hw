# Introduction to Data Visualization Homework 0

**Due: Friday, March 15, 23:59**

Welcome to Introduction to Data Visualization.  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework.  This homework will not be graded, but it is essential that you complete it before starting with HW 1.

## Task 1 - Sign up for github

You'll be using git and [GitHub](http://github.com) to manage your projects and we also suggest you use github to manage your homework.

Sign up for a github account (if you don't already have one) and request a free account upgrade [on this page](https://education.github.com/). You'll need to verify ownership of an **.corp.ifmo.ru (or another edu email) e-mail address** if you didn't sign up with your educational account.

This educational micro-plan will enable you to create five private repositories. We will need at least one per group for the class, if you also manage your homeworks on github you'll need two.

**It is important that you complete this step quickly, as it may take a while for github to provide you with the repositories. Make sure to request a .edu e-mail address if you don't already have one.**

## Task 2 - Class Survey
Please complete the [course survey located here](https://tinyurl.com/itmo-fall18-datavis). It should only take a few moments of your time. It is imperative that you fill out the survey on time.

## Task 3 - Introduction

We will use [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/CeccQVTfUcgfXKPSAJQmBQ) for discussions, to find team members, to arrange appointments, and to ask questions. Slack should be your primary form of communication with the staff and other students.

However, please do not send personal messages to the staff. Instead, use e-mail for personal requests (karsakov@corp.ifmo.ru), e.g., to inform us if you're sick for an exam, etc. If you ask a general question via a personal message or e-mail, we will request that you ask it on Telegram instead. All information such as new homework assignments will be linked from the emails but also announced on Telegram.

## Task 4 - Introduction to HTML, CSS

**There is no need to hand anything in â€” this is an exercise and you can check whether you understood the concepts.**

Take this [quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML) to test your HTML knowledge, and this [one](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=CSS) to evaluate your understanding of CSS. If you feel confident, you can try the [JavaScript quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JavaScript).
